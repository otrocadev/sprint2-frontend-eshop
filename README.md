# Sprint 2.2. e-comerce - IT Academy FrontEnd Course

## üéØ Objectives

The objective in this repo is to imagine a situation and do the steps necessary to implement what we are asked:

>A company in the e-commerce sector has asked us for a web application that allows them to offer the purchase of their products through the internet.
>
>You will be in charge of setting up an initial demo version of the application for the client: management of the shopping cart and the application of the promotions on the final price.

## üèóÔ∏è Things to improve the shop

I will list a few things that I would like to implement in the case of expanding the project or having more time to invest on it:

- [ ] Implement a way to save the cart status from one page to another. There are two main ways possible in my opinion:
   - Using a framework that allows us to have a global status (for a more robust project).
   - Implementing the localStorage API methods to retrieve and storage this data on the memory and loading it when needed. (Better fit for the scope of this project).
- [ ] Implement banners on the products that have promotions so the user can be aware of them.
- [ ] Better mobile compatibility.
